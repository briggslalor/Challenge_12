# Challenge_12

Credit Risk Analysis using Supervised Learning and Logistical Regression

In this project and analysis, the goal was to analyze potential loans and predict whether or not they are healthy or high-risk loans. The analysis is conducted on the financials of potential borrowers, inlcuding their income, debt-to-income ratio, number of accounts, derogatory marks and total debt. Given these variables and the desired loan size and interest rate, we attempted to build a model that could predict whether or not the loan is a healthy option.

## Technologies

This project is built in Python 3.6 and designed to be run in Jupyter Lab. In order to properly utilize the project, the following Python libraries will be used:

   [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)

   [numpy](https://numpy.org/)

   [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
   
   [imblearn](https://imbalanced-learn.org/stable/)


---

## Installation Guide

These libraries can be installed using the pip install syntax. 

```python
pip install -U scikit-learn
```


---

## Usage

Once the proper libraries have been installed into a Python environment, the user can run the project by navigating into the Challenge_12 directory using the command line. When in the directory, the user should open the directory in an instance of Jupyter Lab and run the project. The project will finish running and provide the modeling and analysis of the data. Additional analysis can be found in the analysis ReadMe file.
